Text/Shellwords version 1.08
============================

This is a thin wrapper around the shellwords.pl package, which comes
preinstalled with Perl.  This module imports a single subroutine,
shellwords().  The shellwords() routine parses lines of text and
returns a set of tokens using the same rules that the Unix shell does
for its command-line arguments.  Tokens are separated by whitespace,
and can be delimited by single or double quotes.  The module also
respects backslash escapes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  shellwords.pl (standard part of Perl distribution)
